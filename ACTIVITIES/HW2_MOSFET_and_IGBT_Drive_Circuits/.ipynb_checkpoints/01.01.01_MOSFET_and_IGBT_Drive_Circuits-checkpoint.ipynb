    "(a) The elementary drive circuit is created for Fig.1a using VPULSE for the switch control voltage. The resulting switching waveforms from Probe are shown in Fig.3a. Switching transition times are roughly $1.7$ and $0.5 \\mu s$ for turnoff and turn-on, respectively. Average power absorbed by the MOSFET is determined from Probe by entering AVG(W(M1)), which yields a result of approximately 38 W.\n",

    "(b) The emitter-follower drive circuit of Fig.1c is created using 2N3904 NPN and 2N3906 PNP transistors from the evaluation library. The resulting switching waveforms are shown in Fig.3b. The switching times are roughly $0.4$ and $0.2 \\mu s$ for turnoff and turn-on, and the power absorbed by the transistor is $7.8 W$. Note that the emitter-follower drive circuit removes the gate charge more rapidly than the elementary drive circuit in part (a).\n",
