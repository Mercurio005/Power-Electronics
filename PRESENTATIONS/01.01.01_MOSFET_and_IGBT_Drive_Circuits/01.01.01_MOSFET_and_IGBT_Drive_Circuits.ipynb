    "## Low-Side Drivers\n",
    "The MOSFET is a voltage-controlled device and is relatively simple to turn on and off, which gives it an advantage over a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). The on state is achieved when the gate-to-source voltage sufficiently exceeds the threshold voltage, forcing the MOSFET into the triode (also called ohmic or nonsaturation)region of operation. Typically, the MOSFET gate-to-source voltage for the on state in switching circuits is between $10$ and $20 V$, although some MOSFETs are designed for logic-level control voltages. The off state is achieved by a lower-than-threshold voltage. On- and off-state gate currents are essentially zero. However, the parasitic input capacitance must be charged to turn the MOSFET on and must be discharged to turn it off. Switching speeds are basically determined by how rapidly charge can be transferred to and from the gate.\n",
    "Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are similar to MOSFETs in their drive requirements, and the following discussion applies to them as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "A MOSFET drive circuit must be capable of rapidly sourcing and sinking currents for high-speed switching. The elementary drive circuit of Fig.1a will drive the transistor, but the switching time may be unacceptably high for some applications. Moreover, if the input signal is from low-voltage digital logic devices, the logic output may not be sufficient to turn on the MOSFET.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better drive circuit is shown in Fig.1b The double emitter-follower consists of a matched NPN and PNP bipolar transistor pair. When the drive input voltage is high, $Q_{1}$ is turned on and $Q_{2}$ is off, turning the MOSFET on. When the drive input signal is low, $Q_{1}$ turns off, and $Q_{2}$ turns on and removes the charge from the gate and turns the MOSFET off. \n",

    "Other arrangements for MOSFET drive circuits are shown in Fig.2a. These are functionally equivalent to the BJT double emitter-follower of Fig.1b. The upper and lower transistors are driven as complementary on off transistors, with one transistor sourcing current and the other sinking current to and from the gate of the MOSFET to turn the power MOSFET on and off.

    "## High-Side Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Some converter topologies, such as the buck converter using an N-channel MOSFET, have high-side switches. The source terminal of the high-side MOSFET is not connected to the circuit ground, as it would be in a low-side switch in a converter such as a boost converter. High-side switches require the MOSFET drive circuit to be floating with respect to the circuit ground. Drive circuits for these applications are called high-side drivers. To turn on the MOSFET, the gate-to-source voltage must be sufficiently high. When the MOSFET is on in a buck converter, for example, the voltage at the source terminal of the MOSFET is the same as the supply voltage $V_{s}$. Therefore, the gate voltage must be greater than the supply voltage.\n",

The twover MOSFETs and the diode are labeled as switches $S_{1}$, $S_{2}$, and $S_{3}$. When the control signal is high, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ turn on, and the capacitor charges to $V_{s}$ through the diode (Fig.4b).\n",

The IC with an external capacitor and diode provides the bootstrap circuit for the MOSFET. Another example is the International Rectifier IR2110 that is designed to drive both high-side and low-side switches (Fig.5b).

    "## BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR DRIVE CIRCUITS\n",
    "The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) has largely been replaced by MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, BJTs can be used in many applications. The BJT is a currentcontrolled device, requiring a base current to maintain the transistor in the conducting state. Base current during the on state for a collector current $I_{C}$ must be at least $I_{C} / \\beta$. The turn-on time depends on how rapidly the required stored charge can be delivered to the base region. Turn-on switching speeds can be decreased by initially applying a large spike of base current and then reducing the current to that required to keep the transistor on. Similarly, a negative current spike at turnoff is desirable to remove the stored charge, decreasing transition time from on to off.\n",
